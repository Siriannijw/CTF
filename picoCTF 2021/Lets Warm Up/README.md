## Description
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? 

## Solution
The answer is the ASCII character with a hex value of 0x70. Using the command outputs the character and then needs to be formatted correctly.
```
$ python -c "print(chr(0x70))"
p
```
